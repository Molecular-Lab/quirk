# Target Customers (Ranked by Priority)

## Tier 1: Crypto Payroll Platforms (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Examples**: Rise, Bitwage, Thai payroll startups

**Why They're Perfect:**
- Hold $10-50M in escrow before payroll runs
- Funds sit idle 7-30 days between collection and payout
- Need instant liquidity (payroll can't fail)
- Can't become DeFi experts (focus on HR tech)

**Pain Point**: "We hold $20M earning 0%, customers ask if we offer yield"

**Our Pitch**: "Earn $680k/year, keep $340k, pay us $340k. Zero dev work."

**Expected AUM per Customer**: $10-50M

## Tier 2: Crypto Card Issuers (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Examples**: Thai crypto card startups (non-Bitkub)

**Why They're Perfect:**
- Hold user deposits as collateral for card spending
- High AUM ($5M+ per 10k users)
- Want to offer "3% cashback + 3% on balance"
- Can't build treasury management (focus on card tech)

**Pain Point**: "Users compare us to Crypto.com card. We need better rewards."

**Our Pitch**: "Offer yield-boosted rewards. Your profit: 25 bps on all balances."

**Expected AUM per Customer**: $5-20M

## Tier 3: Web3 Gaming Platforms (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Examples**: Thai P2E games, NFT games

**Why They're Perfect:**
- Hold player deposits in treasury

**Expected AUM per Customer**: $1-10M

## Tier 4: Insurance/Takaful Protocols (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Examples**: Crypto insurance, Islamic finance protocols

**Why They're Perfect:**
- Large premium pools sitting idle

- Sharia-compliant options available (Aave v3 has this)
- Claims are infrequent (high idle time)

**Pain Point**: "Premium pool of $50M earning minimal yield"

**Our Pitch**: "Conservative 3% yield on insurance reserves. Halal-certified."

**Expected AUM per Customer**: $10-50M

## Tier 5: Escrow/Marketplace Platforms (LOW PRIORITY)

**Examples**: Freelance platforms, P2P marketplaces
