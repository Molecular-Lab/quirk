# DeFi Yield Infrastructure - Business Overview

## 🎯 PROJECT FOCUS

**B2B API infrastructure that enables crypto companies to offer yield on user funds without DeFi expertise.**

Think: "Stripe for DeFi Yield" or "Plaid for Crypto Treasury Management"

## Core Value Proposition

- **For Product Owners**: Integrate yield feature in 1 day instead of 6 months
- **For End Users**: Earn 3-4% APY on idle funds (vs 0%)
- **For Us**: Revenue share model (50 bps on AUM)

## What We're NOT

❌ Retail yield platform (like Yearn Finance)
❌ Competitor to CEXs (like Binance Earn)
❌ Generic yield aggregator
❌ Another DeFi protocol

## What We ARE

✅ B2B infrastructure (API-first)
✅ White-label solution (invisible to end users)
✅ Escrow wallet specialist (payroll, cards, insurance, gaming)
✅ Emerging markets focused (Thailand/SEA/Japan)
✅ Partnership-driven (Bitkub, SMBC Nikko)

## 💰 BUSINESS MODEL

### Revenue Model: Asset Under Management (AUM) Based

**Pricing Structure:**
```
Gross Yield: 4.0% (from DeFi protocols)
├─ Our fee: 0.5% (50 bps)
├─ Client fee: 0.25% (25 bps) [they charge customers 0.75%]
└─ User gets: 3.4% net APY

OR

Revenue Share with Partners:
├─ Us: 50 bps
├─ Partner (Bitkub): 25 bps
├─ Client: 25 bps
└─ User: 3% net
```

### Unit Economics

**Per $10M AUM:**
```
Revenue: $50,000/year (50 bps)

Costs:
├─ Oracle infrastructure: $5k/year
├─ Gas costs: $10k/year
├─ Insurance: $5k/year (0.5% of $1M insured)
├─ Support: $10k/year
└─ Total: $30k/year

Profit: $20k/year (40% margin)
```

### Scaling Projections

```
Year 1: $10M AUM → $50k revenue → $20k profit
Year 2: $100M AUM → $500k revenue → $200k profit
Year 3: $500M AUM → $2.5M revenue → $1M profit
Year 5: $2B AUM → $10M revenue → $4M profit
```

## 🎯 Core Positioning

**When in doubt, return to this:**
```
We are NOT: "Another yield aggregator"
We ARE: "B2B infrastructure for embedded DeFi yield"

We do NOT: Compete with Binance/Bitkub
We DO: Enable their ecosystem to offer yield

We are NOT: Building for retail users
We ARE: Building for product owners who serve retail users

We are NOT: A protocol
We ARE: Infrastructure (like Stripe, Plaid, AWS)

We are NOT: Trying to be decentralized purists
We ARE: Trying to get customers and revenue ASAP, then improve
```

**This positioning wins partnerships, funding, and customers.**
