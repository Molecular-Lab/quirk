# Quirk - Business Model & Market Strategy

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-11
**Status:** MVP Development

---

## 🎯 Core Positioning

```
We ARE:  Earn-as-a-Service infrastructure for any app
We're NOT: Direct-to-consumer investment app

We DO:  Enable businesses to offer DeFi yield without building infrastructure
We DON'T: Require businesses to handle compliance or treasury management

We ENABLE: Users to earn yield anywhere they use their money
We ELIMINATE: The barrier that earning must stay in banks/investment apps

Think: Stripe for DeFi Yield + Plaid for Earn-in-App
```

## 💡 The Opportunity

### Market Validation

**DeFi Market Reality:**
- **$50B+ TVL** in DeFi protocols (AAVE, Compound, Morpho)
- **3-5% APY** on stablecoins (proven, sustainable yields)
- **Millions** of active DeFi wallets globally
- **Real product-market fit** in crypto-native space

**The Problem:**
- Users trapped in ecosystem silos (earnings only in banking/investment apps)
- $300B+ idle cash floating across e-commerce, creators, gig workers, freelancers
- Businesses lack crypto expertise to offer DeFi yield
- Regulatory complexity prevents most companies from entering crypto

**The Gap:**
- No B2B infrastructure to embed DeFi yield into traditional apps
- Shopify partners with banks for financial products - businesses want similar for crypto yield
- Users increasingly aware of financial management but limited options

---

## 🎯 Target Customers

### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

**Businesses with:**
- ✅ Users with idle funds (escrow, rewards, balances)
- ✅ No core competency in crypto/DeFi
- ✅ Want to add yield without building crypto infrastructure
- ✅ Revenue model that benefits from user fund retention
- ✅ Already have product-market fit (not early-stage)

**Businesses without:**
- ❌ Crypto/blockchain expertise in-house
- ❌ $3M+ to spend on licenses and compliance
- ❌ 2-3 years to build the infrastructure
- ❌ Risk appetite for regulatory uncertainty

---

### Primary Target Segments

#### 1. Fintech Apps (High Priority)
**Examples:** Neo-banks, digital wallets, payment apps

**Problem:**
- Users hold fiat balances earning 0-0.5% interest
- Need to compete with high-yield offerings
- Can't access DeFi yields (no expertise)

**Why Quirk:**
- Offer "4% APY on stablecoin balance" vs 0.5% on fiat
- No banking license needed (stablecoins, not deposits)
- No DeFi expertise required

**Economics:**
- AUM: $100M+ in user balances
- Revenue: $500k/year (50 bps)
- Customer payback: 3-4 months

#### 2. Gig Workers/Freelance Platforms (High Priority)
**Examples:** Upwork, Fiverr, Fastwork, DAO contributor platforms

**Problem:**
- Escrow funds sit idle for weeks/months
- Platform holds $50M-500M+ in float
- Could be earning on this capital

**Why Quirk:**
- Earn yield on payroll float (new revenue stream)
- Offer workers "earn on pending wages"
- International workers paid in stablecoins (cheaper than SWIFT)

**Economics:**
- Float: $100M average
- Revenue: $500k/year (50 bps)
- Customer payback: <1 month

#### 3. Creator Platforms (Medium-High Priority)
**Examples:** Patreon alternatives, Ko-fi, Web3 social media

**Problem:**
- Creators have earnings sitting in platform wallets
- Withdrawal minimums ($50-100)
- Funds idle for weeks/months
- Platform holds $10M-100M+ in creator funds

**Why Quirk:**
- Creators earn "bonus yield" on pending withdrawals
- Platform can say "We help creators earn more"
- Platform revenue from yield without raising fees

**Economics:**
- AUM: $10M in creator balances
- Revenue: $50k/year (50 bps)
- Customer payback: 3 months

#### 4. E-commerce Platforms (Medium Priority)
**Examples:** Marketplaces, seller platforms

**Problem:**
- Sellers have idle funds waiting for payouts
- Platform holds $100M+ in pending payments

**Why Quirk:**
- Sellers earn yield on pending balances
- Competitive differentiation

**Economics:**
- AUM: $50M+ seller balances
- Revenue: $250k/year (50 bps)
- Customer payback: 2-3 months

## 💰 Revenue Model

### Fee Structure

**Platform Fee:** 0.5% AUM (50 basis points) annually

**Example:**
```
Customer AUM: $10M
Annual Revenue: $10M × 0.005 = $50k
Monthly Revenue: $4,166
```

### Revenue Sharing

**Client Revenue Share:** Configurable (default: 70% to client, 30% to platform)

**Example Calculation:**
```
End-user deposits: $1,000 USDC
Platform fee (50 bps): $5 to Quirk
Deposited to DeFi: $995
APY: 5% annually

After 1 year:
Yield earned: $49.75
Revenue split (70/30):
  - Client: $34.83
  - Quirk: $14.92
End-user receives: $34.82

Total end-user balance: $1,034.82
Effective APY for user: 3.48%
Client revenue: $34.83
Quirk revenue: $19.92 ($5 platform + $14.92 yield share)
```

### Customer Breakeven Analysis

**Minimum Viable AUM:**
```
Integration Cost: $5k-10k (one-time)
API Costs: $500-1k/month ($6k-12k/year)

Breakeven Calculation:
Need to cover $12k/year ongoing costs
$12k / 0.005 (50 bps) = $2.4M minimum AUM

Recommendation: Target customers with $10M+ AUM for comfortable margin
```

**Sweet Spot Customer ($10M AUM):**
```
Revenue: $50k/year
Cost: $10k integration + $12k/year = $22k first year
Net Benefit Year 1: $28k profit ✅
Net Benefit Year 2+: $38k/year profit ✅
Payback Period: 3-4 months
```

## 🏆 Competitive Analysis

### Why Not Build Themselves?

**Cost to Build:**
```
Team:
├─ Smart contract developer: $150k-250k/year
├─ Backend engineer (crypto): $130k-180k/year
├─ DevOps (blockchain): $120k-160k/year
├─ Security auditor: $200k+ (one-time)
└─ Total: $600k-800k/year + $200k audit

Timeline: 6-12 months

Ongoing Costs:
├─ Maintenance: $200k-300k/year
├─ Gas costs: $50k-100k/year
├─ Monitoring: $20k/year
└─ Total: $270k-420k/year
```

**When They'd Build:**
- $10M+ AUM (economics justify it)
- In-house crypto expertise
- Want full control
- Long-term committed to crypto

**Our Advantage:**
- Speed: 1-2 weeks vs 6-12 months
- Cost: $5k-20k vs $800k+
- Risk: We handle protocol risk, security, compliance
- Focus: They focus on core product

### Why Not Direct DeFi Integration?

**What It Is:**
- Integrate directly with AAVE/Compound
- Users earn from DeFi protocol
- No middleman

**Our Advantage:**
- Multi-protocol optimization (better yield than just AAVE)
- Liquidity management (instant withdrawals)
- Risk management (auto-exit if protocol APY drops)
- Fiat on/off ramp (seamless UX)
- Compliance/licensing (we handle regulatory burden)
- Monitoring/alerts (24/7 protocol health)
- Rebalancing (auto-move to best yield)

### Why Not Centralized Yield Providers?

**Examples:** BlockFi, Celsius (both shut down)

**Why They Don't Work:**
- ❌ Regulatory risk (both shut down)
- ❌ Custody risk (platform can lose funds)
- ❌ Bankruptcy risk (users lost everything)
- ❌ Not B2B focused
- ❌ No API-first infrastructure

**Our Advantage:**
- ✅ DeFi-based (transparent, auditable)
- ✅ B2B API-first
- ✅ Multi-protocol (diversified risk)
- ✅ Regulatory compliant

## 📜 Regulatory Compliance (Singapore)

### Required Licenses

**1. MPIL (Major Payment Institution License)**
- **Covers:** Custody + On/Off ramp + Transfer
- **Cost:** ~$300-400K
- **Reference:** [MAS MPIL License](https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/payments/major-payment-institution-licence)

**2. CMS (Capital Markets Services License)**
- **Covers:** Fund Management
- **Cost:** ~$250K
- **Reference:** [MAS CMS License](https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/capital-markets/cms-licence)

**Total Licensing Cost:** ~$550-650K

**Strategy:** Start with partner solutions (TransFi, ZeroHash), get licenses later when scaled

---

## 💵 On/Off Ramp Providers

**Current Options:**
- **[TransFi](https://www.transfi.com/)** - Stablecoins & cross-border payments
- **[ZeroHash](https://zerohash.com/)** - Compliant crypto infrastructure
- **[Bridge](https://www.bridge.xyz/)** - Stablecoin APIs
- **[Magic Labs](https://magic.link/)** - Fastest onchain onboarding

**Strategy:** Use licensed partners for MVP, build own on/off ramp when scaled

---

## 🎓 Customer Success Stories (Hypothetical)

### Case Study: Fastwork (Freelance Platform)

**Profile:**
- Freelance marketplace (Thailand)
