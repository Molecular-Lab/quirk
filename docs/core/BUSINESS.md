# Business Model

## Positioning

**We are:** Earn-as-a-Service infrastructure for any app
**Think:** Stripe for DeFi Yield + Plaid for Earn-in-App

**We enable:** Businesses to offer DeFi yield without building infrastructure
**We eliminate:** The barrier that earning must stay in banks/investment apps

## Market Opportunity

### DeFi Reality
- $50B+ TVL in DeFi protocols
- 3-5% APY on stablecoins (proven, sustainable)
- Millions of active DeFi wallets

### The Gap
- $300B+ idle cash across e-commerce, creators, gig workers
- Businesses lack crypto expertise
- No B2B infrastructure to embed DeFi yield

## Target Customers

### Ideal Profile
- Users with idle funds (escrow, rewards, balances)
- No crypto expertise in-house
- Want yield without building infrastructure
- Already have product-market fit

### Primary Segments

| Segment | Example | AUM | Value Prop |
|---------|---------|-----|------------|
| Fintech | Neo-banks, wallets | $100M+ | 4% APY vs 0.5% fiat |
| Freelance | Upwork, Fiverr | $50-500M | Earn on escrow float |
| Creator | Patreon, Ko-fi | $10-100M | Bonus yield on pending |
| E-commerce | Marketplaces | $50M+ | Seller balance yield |

## Revenue Model

### Fee Structure
- **Platform Fee:** 0.5% AUM annually (50 bps)
- **Revenue Share:** 70% client / 30% platform (configurable)

### Example ($10M AUM)

```
Deposits: $10M USDC
Platform fee (50 bps): $50k/year to Quirk
DeFi APY (5%): $500k yield
Revenue split (70/30):
  - Client: $350k
  - Quirk: $150k
Total Quirk revenue: $200k/year
```

### Customer Economics

| AUM | Annual Revenue | Payback |
|-----|----------------|---------|
| $10M | $50k | 3-4 months |
| $50M | $250k | 2 months |
| $100M | $500k | 1 month |

**Minimum viable AUM:** ~$2.5M to cover costs

## Competitive Advantage

### vs. Build In-House
- **Speed:** 1-2 weeks vs 6-12 months
- **Cost:** $5-20k vs $800k+
