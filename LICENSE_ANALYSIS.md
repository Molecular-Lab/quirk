## Alternative: Banking Partnership Model

Instead of getting licenses yourself, **partner with licensed entity:**

### **Option A: Partner with Licensed Bank**
- Example: Sygnum, Seba, Anchorage
- You become their client/sub-custodian
- **Pros:** No license needed, faster to market
- **Cons:** Revenue share, less control

### **Option B: White-Label Provider**
- Example: Fireblocks, BitGo, Copper
- Use their infrastructure + license
- **Pros:** Quick launch, proven tech
- **Cons:** High fees, dependency

### **Option C: Hybrid Approach**
- Start with partnership (Year 1-2)
- Build customer base
- Apply for own licenses (Year 2-3)
- **Pros:** Best of both worlds
- **Cons:** Double transition

## Key Differences: Banking License vs VASP + Asset Management

| Feature | Full Banking License | VASP + Asset Mgmt |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Cost** | $5M - $20M+ | $1.5M - $2M |
| **Timeline** | 2-3 years | 12-18 months |
| **Compliance** | Extreme (Basel III, etc.) | Moderate (AML/KYC) |
| **Hold fiat** | ✅ Unlimited | ❌ Only during conversion |
| **Hold crypto** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **On/Off Ramp** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **DeFi deployment** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Traditional lending** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Issue credit cards** | ✅ | ❌ |

**Verdict:** VASP + Asset Management is sufficient for Proxify's model

## Can You Do Instant Bank Transfers?

### With VASP License: ✅ YES

**What you CAN do:**
- ✅ Integrate with banking APIs (KBank, SCB, BBL)
- ✅ Generate PromptPay QR codes
- ✅ Accept instant bank transfers
- ✅ Receive real-time payment confirmations
- ✅ Auto-convert fiat → USDC

**What you CANNOT do without banking license:**
- ❌ Auto-pull money from client's account (without their action)
- ❌ Hold large fiat reserves long-term
- ❌ Provide fiat lending

**Solution for auto-pull:**
Partner with payment gateway (Omise, Stripe, 2C2P) - they have the banking licenses and can pull money on your behalf.

---

## Implementation Model

### **Model A: Direct Banking Integration** (With VASP License)
```
Client → Calls API → Get PromptPay QR
      → Scans QR → Pays via mobile banking
      → Proxify receives notification instantly
      → Auto-convert to USDC
      → Update balance ✅
```

### **Model B: Payment Gateway Partnership** (Easier, no license initially)
```
Client → Calls API → Create payment session
      → Redirect to Omise/Stripe
      → User pays
      → Webhook confirms payment
      → Auto-convert to USDC
      → Update balance ✅
```

**Recommendation:** Start with Model B (payment gateway), migrate to Model A after getting VASP license.
